# Organizing threads

Pin a thread from its context menu to keep it in the pinned section above your active work.
`mod+shift+p` pins or unpins the thread you have open. Pinned threads are shown independently of
their project, including when you connect to more than one environment.

To require confirmation before unpinning, enable **Settings → General → Unpin confirmation**. The
confirmation applies to the sidebar controls, thread menus, and the `mod+shift+p` shortcut.

## Starting a thread in the right workspace

When you start a new thread in a Git project, select its workspace in the composer context strip:

- **Current checkout** keeps the repository's main checkout.
- **Existing worktrees** lists worktrees already used by the project, with their branch and path.
- **New worktree** prepares a separate worktree; choose its base branch in the branch selector.

Model selection remains independent of the workspace choice, so a new thread can use a different
model in any existing worktree. A started thread keeps its selected workspace.

The agent is told to edit files, run commands, and use Git only in that workspace. If it uses a
different folder — for example another clone of the same repository — T3 Code shows a warning in
the thread.

A project with a long settled history shows recent chats first. Select **Show more** inside that
project to reveal older settled chats.

Pinned threads still move to **Settled** when they become inactive. They also move when their pull
request merges if **Auto-settle merged threads** is enabled.

When you un-settle a thread, it returns to the top of the active list so you can find it right
away. Its timestamps do not change. Other threads keep their positions.

Right-click a pull request link in a thread and choose **Link to thread** to show that pull request
in the sidebar. The thread settles when the linked pull request merges if **Auto-settle merged
threads** is enabled. Right-click the same link and choose **Unlink from thread** to remove it.

On web and desktop, drag a pinned thread to change its position. On mobile, open the thread's menu
and choose **Move up** or **Move down**. The order is stored by the server and appears on your
other connected devices.

If reordering is unavailable for one environment, update the T3 Code server running in that
environment. Older servers can still pin and unpin threads, but do not understand synced ordering;
their pinned threads keep the default newest-first order below the ones you have arranged.

## Environment artwork

Dev and Nightly environments can identify themselves with artwork at the top of the sidebar and in
the send button. Choose **Artwork**, **Version pill**, or **None** in Settings under environment
identification. Artwork is recolored to match each built-in theme. Custom themes use the **Version
pill** fallback because their colors are not controlled by T3 Code.

To generate a fresh title from the conversation, open a thread's context menu and choose
**Regenerate title**. While T3 Code is generating it, the action reads **Regenerating…** and cannot
be selected again. The option is hidden when the connected environment needs a server update.
